// Add any JavaScript functionality here.  For example, you could add:

// 1.  A function to toggle the navigation menu on small screens.
// 2.  Event listeners to handle clicks on movie/TV show cards to load details.
// 3.  Basic search functionality (without a backend, this would be limited to filtering the displayed content).

console.log("JavaScript loaded!"); // Just a basic check to see if the file is linked correctly.
